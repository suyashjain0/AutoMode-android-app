# MP-AutoMode

This “AutoMode” software is an android based mobile application which is a GPS service based application which would help us in locating the exact geo-position of people depending upon their current location/whereabouts and updates the profile to a desired mode based on entering to a restricted zone already saved. “AutoMode” app feature allows user such as student in a college to get details of all events happening in college and go through timetable of every day in a single swipe rather than going through everywhere around campus. This app can be used at any location which is available on google map. 
The administrator shall register the users on the app for use. The users shall set the location via input location where they want a desired profile. The details of login will be stored on a database which the admin can access after correct login and rest information would be stored on mobile system database.

The database is stored on a server for shared access by user and admin. The application should be provided permissions to use the internet connectivity and to access your device location using GPS turned ON.

System will consist of mobile application and server. The first part of the project involves development of a GPS service based application which would help us in locating the exact geo-position of people depending upon their current location/whereabouts and updates the profile to a desired mode based on location. The second part of the project involves College data management onto Android enabled devices. 
The server will be used for managing the information about the user credentials and also data related to college.
